# Extensions Directory #
------------------------
- The 'extensions' directory should only include functionality built on top of WordPress core functionality.
- Any extensions should have the ability to be included or excluded without breaking the core theme functionality.
- Functionality should be referenced in functions.php ( Ex. require BRACES_TEMPLATE . '/extensions/extension/extension.php'; )
- Extensions should have a consistent folder structure, for example:
- extension
-- extension.php
-- css
-- js
-- images
